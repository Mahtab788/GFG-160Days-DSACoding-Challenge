#.Given a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two nodes n1 and n2 (n1 != n2). You may assume that both nodes exist in the tree. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the given two nodes in the BST.

LCA between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

class Solution {
    Node LCA(Node root, Node n1, Node n2) {
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.data > n1.data && root.data > n2.data) {
                root = root.left; // Move to the left subtree
            } else if (root.data < n1.data && root.data < n2.data) {
                root = root.right; // Move to the right subtree
            } else {
                return root; // Found LCA
            }
        }
        return null; // Should not reach here as n1 and n2 exist in BST
    }
}
