#.Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.


class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] count = new int[n + 1]; // Count array to store frequency of citations
        
        // Populate the count array
        for (int c : citations) {
            if (c >= n) {
                count[n]++;
            } else {
                count[c]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate H-index
        int hIndex = 0;
        for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
            hIndex += count[i]; // Accumulate papers with at least i citations
            if (hIndex >= i) {  // Check if we can have H-index = i
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // If no valid H-index is found
    }
}
