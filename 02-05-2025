#.Given an array of integers arr[] that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the bitonic point, that is the maximum element in the array.
Bitonic Point is a point before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing.

Note: It is guaranteed that the array contains exactly one bitonic point.

lass Solution {
    public int findMaximum(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length-1;i++){
            if(arr[i]>arr[i+1])
                return arr[i];
        } 
        return arr[arr.length-1];
    }
}
