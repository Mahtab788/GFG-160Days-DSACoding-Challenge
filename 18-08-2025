#.You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;
        int idx = 0;
        
        while(idx < n && citations[n-1-idx] > idx){
            idx++;
        }
        return idx;
    }
}
