#.Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, 
the task is to put the items in the knapsack such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 

Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.

class Solution {
    static int knapSack(int W, int val[], int wt[]) {
        int n = val.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][W + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
                if (wt[i - 1] <= j) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], val[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j - wt[i - 1]]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][W];
    }
}
