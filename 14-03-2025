#.Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ]. 
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer. 

class Solution {
    public int countWays(int[] coins, int sum) {
        int[] dp = new int[sum + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // Only one way to make sum 0 (by choosing nothing)

        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int j = coin; j <= sum; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coin]; // Add ways to make (j - coin)
            }
        }
        return dp[sum];
    }
}
