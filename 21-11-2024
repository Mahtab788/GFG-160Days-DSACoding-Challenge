#.Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i],
you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.


class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[]) {
        // code here
        int n=prices.length;
        int maxProfit=0;
        
        // Iterate through the array to find all profit opportunities
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            
            // Add the profit if the stock price increases
            if(prices[i]>prices[i-1]){
                maxProfit +=prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
