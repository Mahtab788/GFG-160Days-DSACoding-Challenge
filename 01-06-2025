#.Given two matrices mat1[][] and mat2[][] of size n x n, where the elements in each matrix are arranged in strictly ascending order. 
Specifically, each row is sorted from left to right, and the last element of a row is smaller than the first element of the next row.
You're given a target value x, your task is to find and count all pairs {a, b} such that a is from mat1 and b is from mat2 where the sum of a + b is equal to x.

class Solution {
    int countPairs(int mat1[][], int mat2[][], int n, int x) {
        int count=0;
        HashSet<Integer> hs=new HashSet<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                hs.add(mat1[i][j]);
            }
        }
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(hs.contains(x-mat2[i][j])){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        } 
        return count;
    }
}
