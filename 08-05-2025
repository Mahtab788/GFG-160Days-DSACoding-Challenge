#.#.Given a sorted array arr[] that represents an Arithmetic Progression (AP) with exactly one missing element, find the missing number.

Note: An element will always exist that, upon inserting into a sequence forms Arithmetic progression. 
If the given sequence already forms a valid complete AP, return the (n+1)-th element that would come next in the sequence.

public int findMissing(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        int diff = (arr[1]-arr[0])<(arr[n-1]-arr[n-2])?(arr[1]-arr[0]):(arr[n-1]-arr[n-2]);
        int left = 0, right = n-1;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            int expected = arr[0] + diff*mid;
            if(arr[mid] == expected){
                left = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return arr[0]+left*diff;
    }
