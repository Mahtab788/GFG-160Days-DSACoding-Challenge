#.In a candy store, there are different types of candies available and prices[i] represent the price of  ith types of candies. You are now provided with an attractive offer.
For every candy you buy from the store, you can get up to k other different candies for free. Find the minimum and maximum amount of money needed to buy all the candies.
Note: In both cases, you must take the maximum number of free candies possible during each purchase.

class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> minMaxCandy(int[] prices, int k) {
        // code here
        int min=0,max=0,i=0,j=prices.length-1;
        Arrays.sort(prices);
        while(i<=j){
            min+=prices[i];
            j-=k;
            i++;
        }
        i=0;
        j=prices.length-1;
        while(i<=j){
            max+=prices[j];
            i+=k;
            j--;
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> res=new ArrayList<>();
        res.add(min);
        res.add(max);
