#.Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot two consecutive houses and aims to maximize his total loot.
Given an array, arr[] where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.
Determine the maximum amount he can loot.

class Solution {
    public int findMaxSum(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return arr[0];

        int prev2 = 0, prev1 = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int pick = arr[i] + prev2; // Loot current house + best till (i-2)
            int skip = prev1;          // Skip current house, take best till (i-1)
            int curr = Math.max(pick, skip);

            prev2 = prev1; // Update for next iteration
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
