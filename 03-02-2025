#.Given a binary tree, find its height.

The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    int height(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return -1; // Return -1 for edge-based height
        
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(node);
        int height = -1;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            height++;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Node curr = queue.poll();
                if (curr.left != null) queue.add(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) queue.add(curr.right);
            }
        }
        
        return height;
    }
}
