#.There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. 
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

class Solution {
    int countWays(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        int prev1 = 2, prev2 = 1, current = 0;
        
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            current = prev1 + prev2;  // Fibonacci-like relation
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        return current;
    }
}
