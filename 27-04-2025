#.Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.
Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. 
There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

class Solution {
    public String multiplyStrings(String s1, String s2) {
        BigInteger b1 = new BigInteger(s1);
        BigInteger b2 = new BigInteger(s2);
        return b1.multiply(b2).toString();
    }
}
